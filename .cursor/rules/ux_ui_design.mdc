## 🎯 Comprehensive Web Interface Guidelines

### Interactions & Accessibility
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: All flows are keyboard-operable & follow WAI-ARIA Authoring Patterns
- **Clear Focus**: Every focusable element shows a visible focus ring. Prefer `:focus-visible` over `:focus`
- **Focus Management**: Use focus traps, move & return focus according to WAI-ARIA Patterns
- **Hit Targets**: Match visual & hit targets. If visual target < 24px, expand hit target to ≥ 24px. Mobile minimum: 44px
- **Mobile Input**: `<input>` font size ≥ 16px on mobile to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom/pan
- **Respect Zoom**: Never disable browser zoom
- **Hydration Safety**: Inputs must not lose focus or value after hydration
- **Paste Support**: Never disable paste in `<input>` or `<textarea>`
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicator & keep original label on buttons
- **Loading Timing**: Add show-delay (~150–300ms) & minimum visible time (~300–500ms) to avoid flicker
- **URL State**: Persist state in URL for share, refresh, Back/Forward navigation (use nuqs)
- **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately when success is likely; reconcile on server response
- **Ellipsis Convention**: Menu options that open follow-up end with ellipsis ("Rename…")
- **Destructive Actions**: Require confirmation or provide Undo with safe window
- **Touch Actions**: Set `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom
- **Tap Highlight**: Set `webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design
- **Tooltip Timing**: Delay first tooltip in group; subsequent peers have no delay
- **Overscroll**: Set `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
- **Scroll Persistence**: Back/Forward restores prior scroll position
- **Autofocus**: Use on desktop screens with single primary input. Rarely on mobile due to layout shift
- **No Dead Zones**: If part of control looks interactive, it should be interactive
- **Deep Linking**: Link filters, tabs, pagination, expanded panels - anytime useState is used
- **Drag Interactions**: Disable text selection & apply inert while dragging
- **Links**: Use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation, never `<button>` or `<div>`
- **Async Updates**: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts & inline validation
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Internationalize for non-QWERTY layouts with platform-specific symbols

### Animations & Motion
- **Motion Preference**: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` with reduced-motion variant
- **Implementation**: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JavaScript libraries
- **Compositor-Friendly**: Prioritize GPU-accelerated properties (`transform`, `opacity`)
- **Necessity**: Only animate when it clarifies cause & effect or adds deliberate delight
- **Easing**: Choose based on what changes (size, distance, trigger)
- **Interruptible**: Animations are cancelable by user input
- **Input-Driven**: Avoid autoplay; animate in response to actions
- **Transform Origin**: Anchor motion to where it "physically" starts
- **Never `transition: all`**: Explicitly list only intended properties
- **SVG Transforms**: Apply to `<g>` wrappers with `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center;`

### Layout & Visual Design
- **Optical Alignment**: Adjust ±1px when perception beats geometry
- **Deliberate Alignment**: Every element aligns intentionally to grid, baseline, edge, or optical center
- **Contrast Balance**: Adjust weight, size, spacing, or color when text & icons sit side by side
- **Responsive Coverage**: Verify on mobile, laptop, & ultra-wide (zoom to 50% for ultra-wide)
- **Safe Areas**: Account for notches & insets with safe-area variables
- **Scrollbars**: Only render useful scrollbars; fix overflow issues
- **Browser Sizing**: Prefer flex/grid/intrinsic layout over measuring in JS
- **Layered Shadows**: Mimic ambient + direct light with at least two layers
- **Crisp Borders**: Combine borders & shadows; semi-transparent borders improve edge clarity
- **Nested Radii**: Child radius ≤ parent radius & concentric so curves align
- **Hue Consistency**: On non-neutral backgrounds, tint borders/shadows/text toward same hue
- **Accessible Charts**: Use color-blind-friendly palettes
- **Minimum Contrast**: Prefer APCA over WCAG 2 for more accurate perceptual contrast
- **Interaction Contrast**: :hover, :active, :focus have more contrast than rest state
- **Browser UI**: Set `<meta name="theme-color">` to align browser theme with page background
- **Color Scheme**: Style `<html>` with `color-scheme: dark` in dark themes
- **Text Anti-aliasing**: Scaling text can change smoothing; prefer animating wrapper
- **Avoid Gradient Banding**: Some colors & display types have banding; use masks instead

### Content & Typography
- **Inline Help**: Prefer inline explanations; use tooltips as last resort
- **Stable Skeletons**: Mirror final content exactly to avoid layout shift
- **Page Titles**: `<title>` reflects current context
- **No Dead Ends**: Every screen offers next step or recovery path
- **All States**: Design empty, sparse, dense, & error states
- **Typography**: Use curly quotes (" ") over straight quotes (" ")
- **Avoid Widows/Orphans**: Tidy rag & line breaks
- **Tabular Numbers**: Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for comparisons
- **Status Cues**: Don't rely on color alone; include text labels
- **Icon Labels**: Convey same meaning with text for non-sighted users
- **Ellipsis Character**: Use … over three periods
- **Anchored Headings**: Set `scroll-margin-top` for headers when linking to sections
- **Content Resilience**: Handle short, average, & very long content
- **Locale Formats**: Format dates, times, numbers, delimiters, & currencies for user's locale
- **Language Detection**: Use Accept-Language header & navigator.languages, never IP/GPS
- **Accessible Content**: Set accurate names (`aria-label`), hide decoration (`aria-hidden`)
- **Icon Buttons**: Provide descriptive `aria-label`
- **Semantics First**: Prefer native elements before `aria-*`
- **Headings**: Hierarchical `<h1–h6>` & "Skip to content" link
- **Non-breaking Spaces**: Use `&nbsp;` for units, shortcuts & names: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`

### Forms & Input Design
- **Enter Submits**: When text input focused, Enter submits
- **Textarea Behavior**: In `<textarea>`, ⌘/⌃+Enter submits; Enter inserts new line
- **Labels Everywhere**: Every control has `<label>` or is associated with label
- **Label Activation**: Clicking `<label>` focuses associated control
- **Submission Rule**: Keep submit enabled until submission starts; disable during request
- **Don't Block Typing**: Allow any input & show validation feedback
- **Don't Pre-disable**: Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation
- **No Dead Zones**: Checkboxes & radios avoid dead zones; label & control share hit target
- **Error Placement**: Show errors next to fields; on submit, focus first error
- **Autocomplete**: Set autocomplete & meaningful name values for autofill
- **Spellcheck**: Disable for emails, codes, usernames, etc.
- **Input Types**: Use correct type & inputmode for better keyboards & validation
- **Placeholders**: Signal emptiness, end with ellipsis
- **Placeholder Value**: Set to example value or pattern
- **Unsaved Changes**: Warn before navigation when data could be lost
- **Password Managers**: Ensure compatibility & allow pasting one-time codes
- **Avoid Password Triggers**: For non-auth fields, avoid reserved names, use `autocomplete="off"`
- **Text Replacements**: Trim input values to avoid confusing error messages
- **Windows Select**: Explicitly set background-color & color on native `<select>`

### Performance & Optimization
- **Device Matrix**: Test iOS Low Power Mode & macOS Safari
- **Measure Reliably**: Disable extensions that add overhead
- **Track Re-renders**: Minimize & make re-renders fast
- **Throttle Profiling**: Test with CPU & network throttling
- **Minimize Layout**: Batch reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints
- **Network Budget**: POST/PATCH/DELETE complete in <500ms
- **Keystroke Cost**: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap
- **Large Lists**: Virtualize with virtua or `content-visibility: auto`
- **Preload Wisely**: Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load rest
- **No Image CLS**: Set explicit image dimensions & reserve space
- **Preconnect**: Use `<link rel="preconnect">` for asset/CDN domains
- **Preload Fonts**: For critical text to avoid flash & layout shift
- **Subset Fonts**: Ship only code points/scripts you use via unicode-range
- **Web Workers**: Move long tasks to Web Workers to avoid blocking main thread

### Copywriting & Content Strategy
- **Active Voice**: Instead of "The CLI will be installed," say "Install the CLI."
- **Title Case**: Headings & buttons use Title Case (Chicago). Marketing pages use sentence case.
- **Clear & Concise**: Use as few words as possible.
- **Prefer &**: Use & over and.
- **Action-Oriented**: Instead of "You will need the CLI…" say "Install the CLI…"
- **Consistent Nouns**: Introduce as few unique terms as possible.
- **Second Person**: Write in second person. Avoid first person.
- **Consistent Placeholders**: Strings: YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE. Numbers: 0123456789.
- **Numerals for Counts**: Instead of "eight deployments" say "8 deployments"
- **Currency Formatting**: In any given context, display currency with either 0 or 2 decimal places, never mix both.
- **Space Separation**: Instead of 10MB say 10 MB. Use non-breaking space: `10&nbsp;MB`
- **Positive Language**: Frame messages in encouraging, problem-solving way, even for errors.
- **Error Guidance**: Don't just state what went wrong—tell user how to fix it.
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Labels are clear & specific. Instead of "Continue" say "Save API Key"
